Doctors can now 3D print a mini human heart.
In Sept. 2019, BIOLIFE4D became the first U.S. company to 3D print a mini human heart with the exact structure of a full-sized heart and many of the same functions. It's a major milestone toward the company's ultimate objective: 3D-printing full-sized human hearts that can be used by surgeons in transplants and by pharmaceutical companies for safer, faster testing of new cardiac therapies.
MIT's 3D-printed hearts could pump new life into customized treatments. Engineers can now print three-dimensional replicas of a human heart custom-designed to look and act like an individual patient's heart.
