Oatmeal helps fight depression.
People experiencing depression and insomnia (or both, as they're often linked) have a lack of serotonin, a hormone synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. So, eating foods high in tryptophan—like oatmeal, eggs, chicken, and peanuts—can help regulate mood and sleep, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Nutrients.Complex carbohydrates are wonderful foods to improve mood quickly,” says Debbie Mandel, a stress management expert and author of Addicted to Stress. “Whole grains, brown rice, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and whole wheat pasta are all good choices. They help the body release serotonin.”
