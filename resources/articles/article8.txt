Working out regularly shrinks your fat cells.
Your body needs fuel in order to function and perform work (such as exercise). Your body gets this fuel from the foods you eat. Foods can be divided into three macronutrients; carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Your body’s primary source of energy comes from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are extremely important to give you the energy you need to exercise and perform activities of daily living. The body’s next source of energy is fat. Like carbohydrates, fat can be easily converted into fuel the body needs. And sometimes protein can be used as fuel; but its primary function is to build and repair tissues.When you exercise your body will primarily “burn” carbohydrates and fat; much like a car uses gasoline. Exercise helps someone burn fat because exercise requires more fuel than being sedentary (like a speeding race car needs more gasoline). As you exercise your body will convert fat to be used as fuel for working muscles. In addition, as someone becomes fit their body becomes more efficient at using fat as a fuel source.Fat cells cannot become muscle cells since the components of one cell type are different from the other. When you exercise, your muscles grow larger and the energy used during exercise makes the fat cells shrink.Fat cells cannot become muscle cells since the components of one cell type are different from the other.
