 Swimming Is A Great Form Of Exercise Because It Incorporates Both Cardio And Strength Training
When it comes to swimming, people have two main problems. Finding a suitable lap pool is the first and the second is how challenging swimming actually is. Swimming is essentially a full-body workout. Just 20 minutes in the water may burn over 250 calories, pretty much the same (if not more) as running. Every muscle fiber in your body, from your core to your extremities, is activated when swimming. No other activities are as demanding on your upper and lower body while being kind to joints. Additionally, the anaerobic nature of the sport will immediately increase your heart rate by promoting hypertrophy and, essentially, muscular growth.
