 Music Can Improve Your Training Performance
The body of research on workout music has grown significantly over the past ten years, assisting psychologists in better understanding why exercise and music are such a powerful combination for so many people. Music improves mood, reduces perceived effort, boosts endurance, diverts attention from pain and exhaustion, and may even encourage metabolic efficiency. People run farther, ride farther, and swim faster while listening to music â€” often without even realizing it. In fact, research showed that runners who listened to upbeat music throughout a race finished it more quickly than those who didn't.
